<a href="mailto:leancamsys@gmail.com">leancamsys@gmail.com</a>

// WhatsApp
<a href="https://wa.me/17155013103">Message on WhatsApp</a>
```

**2. Link All CTA Buttons to Contact Page:**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **User Experience**: Form shows success message even if email fails (graceful degradation)
- **Testing**: Always test after adding credentials

### Security:
- 🔒 App Password is safer than regular Gmail password
- 🔒 Never commit `config.js` with real credentials to public repos
- 🔒 Form includes NDA and Terms checkboxes (links need to be created)

### Browser Tab Icon:
- ✅ Favicon added to `app/favicon.ico`
- ✅ Will show automatically in browser tabs
- ✅ Works on all modern browsers

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Currently Not Implemented:
1. **File Upload**: UI exists but no backend handling
2. **Live Chat**: Button exists but not connected
3. **Video Player**: Play button exists but no video source
4. **Booking System**: Schedule buttons need Calendly integration
5. **Legal Pages**: Privacy Policy, Terms, NDA need to be created

### Intentional Placeholders:
- Most CTA buttons are decorative (design phase)
- Social media icons have no URLs
- Some footer links point nowhere
- Blog and Careers pages don't exist yet

📖 **Full Details**: See `BROKEN_LINKS_SUMMARY.md`
